  <p>The Working Group must be able to show evidence of having attempted to respond to and satisfy reviewers. Reviewers may register a formal objection any time they are dissatisfied with how a Working Group has handled an issue.
A Working Group should negotiate review schedules with other groups expected to review a document, including relevant liaisons.
There are two formal review periods with fixed durations when advancing to Recommendation: after a Last Call announcement and after a Call for Review of a Proposed Recommendation. Out of consideration for the Working Group, reviewers should send their comments early in a review period. A Working Group should not start a new review before the scheduled end of an ongoing review (e.g., do not start a new Last Call review before the scheduled end of an ongoing Last Call review).</p>
