  <p>A document receives review from the moment it is first published. Starting with the First Public Working Draft until the start of a Proposed Recommendation review, a Working Group must formally address any substantive review comment about a technical report and should do so in a timely manner. The Director must formally address any substantive issue raised by Advisory Committee representatives during Proposed Recommendation, Proposed Edited Recommendation, and Proposed Rescinded Recommendation review periods. The Working Group must communicate to the Director (usually through the Team Contact) any substantive issues raised during Proposed Recommendation, Proposed Edited Recommendation, and Proposed Rescinded Recommendation review periods by parties other than Advisory Committee representatives.</p>
